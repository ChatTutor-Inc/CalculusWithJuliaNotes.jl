# The issue with `PlotlyLight` appears to be that
# the `str` below is called *after* the inclusion of `require.min.js`
# (That str is included in the `.qmd` file to be included in the header
# but the order of inclusion appears not to be adjustable)
# This little script just adds a line *before* the require call
# which seems to make it all work. The line number 83 might change.
