The trace of a parameterized curve is a path.\n  * functions $F:R^n \\rightarrow R^m$, may be called vector fields in applications. They are also used to describe transformations.\n\n\nWhen $m>1$ a function is called *vector valued*.\n\n\nWhen $n>1$ the argument may be given in terms of components, e.g. $f(x,y,z)$; with a point as an argument, $F(p)$; or with a vector as an argument, $F(\\vec{a})$. The identification of a point with a vector is done frequently.\n\n\n## Limits\n\n\nLimits when $m > 1$ depend on the limits of each component existing.\n\n\nLimits when $n > 1$ are more complicated. One characterization is a limit at a point $c$ exists if and only if for *every* continuous path going to $c$ the limit along the path for every component exists in the univariate sense.\n\n\n## Derivatives\n\n\nThe derivative of a univariate function, $f$, at a point $c$ is defined by a limit:\n\n\n\n$$\nf'(c) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h},\n$$\n\n\nand as a function by considering the mapping $c$ into $f'(c)$. A characterization is it is the value for which\n\n\n\n$$\n|f(c+h) - f(h) - f'(c)h| = \\mathcal{o}(|h|),\n$$\n\n\nThat is,  after dividing the left-hand side by $|h|$ the expression goes to $0$ as $|h|\\rightarrow 0$. This characterization will generalize with the norm replacing the absolute value, as needed.\n\n\n### Parameterized curves\n\n\nThe derivative of a function $\\vec{r}: R \\rightarrow R^m$, $\\vec{r}'(t)$, is found by taking the derivative of each component. (The function consisting of just one component is univariate.)\n\n\nThe derivative satisfies\n\n\n\n$$\n\\| \\vec{r}(t+h) - \\vec{r}(t) - \\vec{r}'(t) h \\| = \\mathcal{o}(|h|).\n$$\n\n\nThe derivative is *tangent* to the curve and indicates the direction of travel.\n\n\nThe **tangent** vector is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{r}'(t)$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\hat{T} = \\frac{\\vec{r}'(t)}{\\|\\vec{r}(t)\\|}.\n$$\n\n\nThe path is parameterized by *arc* length if $\\|\\vec{r}'(t)\\| = 1$ for all $t$. In this case an \"$s$\" is used for the parameter, as a notational hint: $\\hat{T} = d\\vec{r}/ds$.\n\n\nThe **normal** vector is the unit vector in the direction of the derivative of the tangent vector:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\hat{N} = \\frac{\\hat{T}'(t)}{\\|\\hat{T}'(t)\\|}.\n$$\n\n\nIn dimension $m=2$, if $\\hat{T} = \\langle a, b\\rangle$ then $\\hat{N} = \\langle -b, a\\rangle$ or $\\langle b, -a\\rangle$ and $\\hat{N}'(t)$ is parallel to $\\hat{T}$.\n\n\nIn dimension $m=3$, the **binormal** vector, $\\hat{B}$, is the unit vector $\\hat{T}\\times\\hat{N}$.\n\n\nThe [Frenet-Serret]() formulas define the **curvature**, $\\kappa$,  and the **torsion**, $\\tau$, by\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d\\hat{T}}{ds} &=  & \\kappa \\hat{N} &\\\\\n\\frac{d\\hat{N}}{ds} &= -\\kappa\\hat{T} & & + \\tau\\hat{B}\\\\\n\\frac{d\\hat{B}}{ds} &= & -\\tau\\hat{N}&\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThese formulas apply in dimension $m=2$ with $\\hat{B}=\\vec{0}$.\n\n\nThe curvature, $\\kappa$, can be visualized by imagining a circle of radius $r=1/\\kappa$ best approximating the path at a point. (A straight line would have a circle of infinite radius and curvature $0$.)\n\n\nThe chain rule says $(\\vec{r}(g(t))' = \\vec{r}'(g(t)) g'(t)$.\n\n\n### Scalar functions\n\n\nA scalar function, $f:R^n\\rightarrow R$, $n > 1$ has a **partial derivative** defined. For $n=2$, these are:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}(x,y) &=\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}(x,y) &=\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThe generalization to $n>2$ is clear - the partial derivative in $x_i$ is the derivative of $f$ when the *other* $x_j$ are held constant.\n\n\nThis may be viewed as the derivative of the univariate function $(f\\circ\\vec{r})(t)$ where $\\vec{r}(t) = p + t \\hat{e}_i$, $\\hat{e}_i$ being the unit vector of all $0$s except a $1$ in the $i$th component.\n\n\nThe **gradient** of $f$, when the limits exist, is the vector-valued function for $R^n$ to $R^n$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla{f} = \\langle\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x_1}},\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x_2}},\n\\dots\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x_n}}\n\\rangle.\n$$\n\n\nThe gradient satisfies:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\|f(\\vec{x}+\\Delta{\\vec{x}}) - f(\\vec{x}) - \\nabla{f}\\cdot\\Delta{\\vec{x}}\\| = \\mathcal{o}(\\|\\Delta{\\vec{x}\\|}).\n$$\n\n\nThe gradient is viewed as a column vector. If the dot product above is viewed as matrix multiplication, then it would be written $\\nabla{f}' \\Delta{\\vec{x}}$.\n\n\n**Linearization** is the *approximation*\n\n\n\n$$\nf(\\vec{x}+\\Delta{\\vec{x}}) \\approx f(\\vec{x}) + \\nabla{f}\\cdot\\Delta{\\vec{x}}.\n$$\n\n\nThe **directional derivative** of $f$ in the direction $\\vec{v}$ is $\\vec{v}\\cdot\\nabla{f}$, which can be seen as the derivative of the univariate function $(f\\circ\\vec{r})(t)$ where $\\vec{r}(t) = p + t \\vec{v}$.\n\n\nFor the function $z=f(x,y)$ the gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent. Ascent is seen in the $3$d surface, the gradient is $2$ dimensional.\n\n\nFor a function $f(\\vec{x})$, a **level curve** is the set of values for which $f(\\vec{x})=c$, $c$ being some constant. Plotted, this may give a curve or surface (in $n=2$ or $n=3$). The gradient at a point $\\vec{x}$ with $f(\\vec{x})=c$ will be *orthogonal* to the level curve $f=c$.\n\n\nPartial derivatives are scalar functions, so will themselves have partial derivatives when the limits are defined. The notation $f_{xy}$ stands for the partial derivative in $y$ of the partial derivative of $f$ in $x$. [Schwarz]()'s theorem says the order of partial derivatives will not matter (e.g., $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$) provided the higher-order derivatives are continuous.\n\n\nThe chain rule applied to $(f\\circ\\vec{r})(t)$ says:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{d(f\\circ\\vec{r})}{dt} = \\nabla{f}(\\vec{r}) \\cdot \\vec{r}'.\n$$\n\n\n### Vector-valued functions\n\n\nFor a function $F:R^n \\rightarrow R^m$, the **total derivative** of $F$ is the linear operator $d_F$ satisfying:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\|F(\\vec{x} + \\vec{h})-F(\\vec{x}) - d_F \\vec{h}\\| = \\mathcal{o}(\\|\\vec{h}\\|)\n$$\n\n\nFor $F=\\langle f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_m\\rangle$ the total derivative is the  **Jacobian**, a $m \\times n$ matrix of partial derivatives:\n\n\n\n$$\nJ_f = \\left[\n\\begin{align}{}\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} &\\quad \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} &\\dots&\\quad\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1} &\\quad \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} &\\dots&\\quad\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_n}\\\\\n&&\\vdots&\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} &\\quad \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_2} &\\dots&\\quad\\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n}\n\\end{align}\n\\right].\n$$\n\n\nThis can be viewed as being comprised of row vectors, each being the individual gradients; or as column vectors each being the vector of partial derivatives for a given variable.\n\n\nThe **chain rule** for $F:R^n \\rightarrow R^m$ composed with $G:R^k \\rightarrow R^n$ is:\n\n\n\n$$\nd_{F\\circ G}(a) = d_F(G(a)) d_G(a),\n$$\n\n\nThat is the total derivative of $F$ at the point $G(a)$ times (matrix multiplication) the total derivative of $G$ at $a$.  The dimensions work out as $d_F$ is $m\\times n$ and $d_G$ is $n\\times k$, so $d_(F\\circ G)$ will be $m\\times k$ and $F\\circ{G}: R^k\\rightarrow R^m$.\n\n\nA scalar function $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$ and a parameterized curve $\\vec{r}:R\\rightarrow R^n$ composes to yield a univariate function. The total derivative of $f\\circ\\vec{r}$ satisfies:\n\n\n\n$$\nd_f(\\vec{r}) d_\\vec{r} = \\nabla{f}(\\vec{r}(t))' \\vec{r}'(t) =\n\\nabla{f}(\\vec{r}(t)) \\cdot \\vec{r}'(t),\n$$\n\n\nas above. (There is an identification of a $1\\times 1$ matrix with a scalar in re-expressing as a dot product.)\n\n\n### The divergence, curl, and their vanishing properties\n\n\nDefine the **divergence** of a vector-valued function $F:R^n \\rightarrow R^n$ by:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\text{divergence}(F) =\n\\frac{\\partial{F_{x_1}}}{\\partial{x_1}} +\n\\frac{\\partial{F_{x_2}}}{\\partial{x_2}} + \\cdots\n\\frac{\\partial{F_{x_n}}}{\\partial{x_n}}.\n$$\n\n\nThe divergence is a scalar function. For a vector field $F$, it measures the microscopic flow out of a region.\n\n\nA vector field whose divergence is identically $0$ is called **incompressible**.\n\n\nDefine the **curl** of a *two*-dimensional vector field, $F:R^2 \\rightarrow R^2$, by:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\text{curl}(F) = \\frac{\\partial{F_y}}{\\partial{x}} -\n\\frac{\\partial{F_x}}{\\partial{y}}.\n$$\n\n\nThe curl for $n=2$ is a scalar function.\n\n\nFor $n=3$ define the **curl** of $F:R^3 \\rightarrow R^3$ to be the *vector field*:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\text{curl}(F) =\n\\langle \\\n\\frac{\\partial{F_z}}{\\partial{y}} - \\frac{\\partial{F_y}}{\\partial{z}},\n\\frac{\\partial{F_x}}{\\partial{z}} - \\frac{\\partial{F_z}}{\\partial{x}},\n\\frac{\\partial{F_y}}{\\partial{x}} - \\frac{\\partial{F_x}}{\\partial{y}}\n\\rangle.\n$$\n\n\nThe curl measures the circulation in a vector field. In dimension $n=3$ it *points* in the direction of the normal of the plane of maximum circulation with direction given by the right-hand rule.\n\n\nA vector field whose curl is identically of magnitude $0$ is called **irrotational**.\n\n\nThe $\\nabla$ operator is the *formal* vector\n\n\n\n$$\n\\nabla = \\langle\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x}},\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{y}},\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{z}}\n\\rangle.\n$$\n\n\nThe gradient is then scalar \"multiplication\" on the left: $\\nabla{f}$.\n\n\nThe divergence is the dot product on the left: $\\nabla\\cdot{F}$.\n\n\nThe curl is the the cross product on the left: $\\nabla\\times{F}$.\n\n\nThese operations satisfy two vanishing properties:\n\n\n  * The curl of a gradient is the zero vector: $\\nabla\\times\\nabla{f}=\\vec{0}$\n  * The divergence of a curl is $0$: $\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times F)=0$\n\n\n[Helmholtz]() decomposition theorem says a vector field ($n=3$) which vanishes rapidly enough can be expressed in terms of $F = -\\nabla\\phi + \\nabla\\times{A}$. The left term will be irrotational (no curl) and the right term will be incompressible (no divergence).\n\n\n## Integrals\n\n\nThe definite integral, $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$, for a bounded univariate function is defined in terms Riemann sums, $\\lim \\sum f(c_i)\\Delta{x_i}$ as the maximum *partition* size goes to $0$. Similarly the integral of a bounded scalar function $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$ over a box-like region $[a_1,b_1]\\times[a_2,b_2]\\times\\cdots\\times[a_n,b_n]$ can be defined in terms of a limit of Riemann sums. A Riemann integrable function is one for which the upper and lower Riemann sums agree in the limit. A characterization of a Riemann integrable function is that the set of discontinuities has measure $0$.\n\n\nIf $f$ and the partial functions ($x \\rightarrow f(x,y)$ and $y \\rightarrow f(x,y)$) are Riemann integrable, then Fubini's theorem allows the definite integral to be performed iteratively:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_{R\\times S}fdV = \\int_R \\left(\\int_S f(x,y) dy\\right) dx\n= \\int_S \\left(\\int_R f(x,y) dx\\right) dy.\n$$\n\n\nThe integral satisfies linearity and monotonicity properties that follow from the definitions:\n\n\n  * For integrable $f$ and $g$ and constants $a$ and $b$:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R (af(x) + bg(x))dV = a\\iint_R f(x)dV + b\\iint_R g(x) dV.\n$$\n\n\n  * If $R$ and $R'$ are *disjoint* rectangular regions (possibly sharing a boundary), then the integral over the union is defined by linearity:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_{R \\cup R'} f(x) dV = \\iint_R f(x)dV + \\iint_{R'} f(x) dV.\n$$\n\n\n  * As $f$ is bounded, let $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x$ in $R$. Then\n\n\n\n$$\nm V(R) \\leq \\iint_R f(x) dV \\leq MV(R).\n$$\n\n\n  * If $f$ and $g$ are integrable *and* $f(x) \\leq g(x)$, then the integrals have the same property, namely $\\iint_R f dV \\leq \\iint_R gdV$.\n  * If $S \\subset R$, both closed rectangles, then if $f$ is integrable over $R$ it will be also over $S$ and, when $f\\geq 0$, $\\iint_S f dV \\leq \\iint_R fdV$.\n  * If $f$ is bounded and integrable, then $|\\iint_R fdV| \\leq \\iint_R |f| dV$.\n\n\nIn two dimensions, we have the following interpretations:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\iint_R dA &= \\text{area of } R\\\\\n\\iint_R \\rho dA &= \\text{mass with constant density }\\rho\\\\\n\\iint_R \\rho(x,y) dA &= \\text{mass of region with density }\\rho\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{area}}\\iint_R x \\rho(x,y)dA &= \\text{centroid of region in } x \\text{ direction}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{area}}\\iint_R y \\rho(x,y)dA &= \\text{centroid of region in } y \\text{ direction}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nIn three dimensions, we have the following interpretations:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\iint_VdV &= \\text{volume of } V\\\\\n\\iint_V \\rho dV &= \\text{mass with constant density }\\rho\\\\\n\\iint_V \\rho(x,y) dV &= \\text{mass of volume with density }\\rho\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{volume}}\\iint_V x \\rho(x,y)dV &= \\text{centroid of volume in } x \\text{ direction}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{volume}}\\iint_V y \\rho(x,y)dV &= \\text{centroid of volume in } y \\text{ direction}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{volume}}\\iint_V z \\rho(x,y)dV &= \\text{centroid of volume in } z \\text{ direction}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nTo compute integrals over non-box-like regions, Fubini's theorem may be utilized. Alternatively, a **transformation** of variables\n\n\n### Line integrals\n\n\nFor a parameterized curve, $\\vec{r}(t)$, the **line integral** of a scalar function between $a \\leq  t \\leq b$ is defined by: $\\int_a^b f(\\vec{r}(t)) \\| \\vec{r}'(t)\\| dt$. For a path parameterized by arc-length, the integral is expressed by $\\int_C f(\\vec{r}(s)) ds$ or simply $\\int_C f ds$, as the norm is $1$ and $C$ expresses the path.\n\n\nA Jordan curve in two dimensions is a non-intersecting continuous loop in the plane. The Jordan curve theorem states that such a curve divides the plane into a bounded and unbounded region. The curve is *positively* parameterized if the the bounded region is kept on the left. A line integral over a Jordan curve is denoted $\\oint_C f ds$.\n\n\nSome interpretations: $\\int_a^b \\| \\vec{r}'(t)\\| dt$ computes the *arc-length*. If the path represents a wire with density $\\rho(\\vec{x})$ then $\\int_a^b \\rho(\\vec{r}(t)) \\|\\vec{r}'(t)\\| dt$ computes the mass of the wire.\n\n\nThe line integral is also defined for a vector field $F:R^n \\rightarrow R^n$ through $\\int_a^b F(\\vec{r}(t)) \\cdot \\vec{r}'(t) dt$. When parameterized by arc length, this becomes $\\int_C F(\\vec{r}(s)) \\cdot \\hat{T} ds$ or more simply $\\int_C F\\cdot\\hat{T}ds$. In dimension $n=2$ if $\\hat{N}$ is the normal, then this line integral (the flow) is also of interest $\\int_a^b F(\\vec{r}(t)) \\cdot \\hat{N} dt$ (this is also expressed by $\\int_C F\\cdot\\hat{N} ds$).\n\n\nWhen $F$ is a *force field*, then the interpretation of $\\int_a^b F(\\vec{r}(t)) \\cdot \\vec{r}'(t) dt$ is the amount of *work* to move an object from $\\vec{r}(a)$ to $\\vec{r}(b)$. (Work measures force applied times distance moved.)\n\n\nA **conservative force** is a force field within an open region $R$ with the property that the total work done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken. (Similarly, integrals over Jordan curves are zero.)\n\n\nThe gradient theorem or **fundamental theorem of line integrals** states if $\\phi$ is a scalar function then the vector field $\\nabla{\\phi}$ (if continuous in $R$) is a conservative field. That is if $q$ and $p$ are points, $C$ any curve in $R$, and $\\vec{r}$ a parameterization of $C$ over $[a,b]$ that $\\phi(p) - \\phi(q) = \\int_a^b \\nabla{f}(\\vec{r}(t)) \\cdot \\vec{r}'(t) dt$.\n\n\nIf $\\phi$ is a scalar function producing a field $\\nabla{\\phi}$ then in dimensions $2$ and $3$ the curl of $\\nabla{\\phi}$ is zero when the functions involved are continuous. Conversely, if the curl of a force field, $F$, is zero *and* the derivatives are continuous in a *simply connected* domain, then there exists a scalar potential function, $\\phi,$ with $F = -\\nabla{\\phi}$.\n\n\nIn dimension $2$, if $F$ describes a flow field, the integral $\\int_C F \\cdot\\hat{N}ds$ is interpreted as the flow across the curve $C$; when $C$ is a closed curve $\\oint_C F\\cdot\\hat{N}ds$ is interpreted as the flow out of the region, when $C$ is positively parameterized.\n\n\n**Green's theorem** states if $C$ is a positively oriented Jordan curve in the plane bounding a region $D$ and $F$ is a vector field $F:R^2 \\rightarrow R^2$ then $\\oint_C F\\cdot\\hat{T}ds = \\iint_D \\text{curl}(F) dA$.\n\n\nGreen's theorem can be re-expressed in flow form: $\\oint_C F\\cdot\\hat{N}ds=\\iint_D\\text{divergence}(F)dA$.\n\n\nFor $F=\\langle -y,x\\rangle$, Green's theorem says the area of $D$ is given by $(1/2)\\oint_C F\\cdot\\vec{r}' dt$. Similarly, if $F=\\langle 0,x\\rangle$ or $F=\\langle -y,0\\rangle$ then the area is given by $\\oint_C F\\cdot\\vec{r}'dt$. The above follows as $\\text{curl}(F)$ is $2$ or $1$. Similar formulas can be given to compute the centroids, by identifying a vector field with  $\\text{curl}(F) = x$ or $y$.\n\n\n### Surface integrals\n\n\nA surface in $3$ dimensions can be described by a scalar function $z=f(x,y)$, a parameterization $F:R^2 \\rightarrow R^3$ or as a level curve of a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$. The second case, covers the first through the parameterization $(x,y) \\rightarrow (x,y,f(x,y)$. For a parameterization of a surface, $\\Phi(u,v) = \\langle \\Phi_x, \\Phi_y, \\Phi_z\\rangle$, let $\\partial{\\Phi}/\\partial{u}$ be the $3$-d vector $\\langle \\partial{\\Phi_x}/\\partial{u}, \\partial{\\Phi_y}/\\partial{u}, \\partial{\\Phi_z}/\\partial{u}\\rangle$, similarly define $\\partial{\\Phi}/\\partial{v}$. As vectors, these lie in the tangent plane to the surface and this plane has normal vector $\\vec{N}=\\partial{\\Phi}/\\partial{u}\\times\\partial{\\Phi}/\\partial{v}$. For a closed surface, the parametrization is positive if $\\vec{N}$ is an outward pointing normal. Let the *surface element* be defined by $\\|\\vec{N}\\|$.\n\n\nThe surface integral of a scalar function $f:R^3 \\rightarrow R$ for a parameterization $\\Phi:R \\rightarrow S$ is defined by\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R f(\\Phi(u,v))\n\\|\\frac{\\partial{\\Phi}}{\\partial{u}} \\times \\frac{\\partial{\\Phi}}{\\partial{v}}\\|\ndu dv\n$$\n\n\nIf $F$ is a vector field, the surface integral may be defined as a flow across the boundary through\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_R F(\\Phi(u,v)) \\cdot \\vec{N} du dv =\n\\iint_R (F \\cdot \\hat{N}) \\|\\frac{\\partial{\\Phi}}{\\partial{u}} \\times \\frac{\\partial{\\Phi}}{\\partial{v}}\\| du dv = \\iint_S (F\\cdot\\hat{N})dS\n$$\n\n\n### Stokes' theorem, divergence theorem\n\n\n**Stokes' theorem** states that in dimension $3$ if $S$ is a smooth surface with boundary $C$ – *oriented* so the right-hand rule gives the choice of normal for $S$ – and $F$ is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives then:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_S (\\nabla\\times{F}) \\cdot \\hat{N} dS = \\oint_C F ds.\n$$\n\n\nStokes' theorem has the same formulation as Green's theorem in dimension $2$, where the surface integral is just the $2$-dimensional integral.\n\n\nStokes' theorem is used to show a vector field $F$ with zero curl is conservative if $F$ is continuous in a simply connected region.\n\n\nStokes' theorem is used in Physics, for example, to relate the differential and integral forms of $2$ of Maxwell's equations.\n\n---\n\n\nThe **divergence theorem** states if $V$ is a compact volume in $R^3$ with piecewise smooth boundary $S=\\partial{V}$ and $F$ is a vector field with continuous partial derivatives then:\n\n\n\n$$\n\\iint_V (\\nabla\\cdot{F})dV = \\oint_S (F\\cdot\\hat{N})dS.\n$$\n\n\nThe divergence theorem is available for other dimensions. In the $n=2$ case, it is the alternate (flow) form of  Green's theorem.\n\n\nThe divergence theorem is used in Physics to express physical laws in either integral or differential form.\n\n",
